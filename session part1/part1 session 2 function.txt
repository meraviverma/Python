variables and Memory
------------------------
In Python, we can finds out the memory address reference by a variable
by using the id() function.

By using the hex() function we can find the hexdecimal value of that.

reference counting
---------------------
Python Memory Manager is doing this.

Finding the reference Count

sys.getrefcount(my_var) <---- passing my_var to getrefcount() creates an extra reference.
